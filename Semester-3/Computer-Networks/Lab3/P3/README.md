# Lab 3
Implement the Chat server example using UDP and TCP â€“only this time each client should contact the server just for registration. All communication happens directly between the peers (clients) without passing trough the server. Each client maintains an endpoint (TCP/UDP) with the server just for learning the arrival/departure of other clients. You create a mesh architecture where all clients connect directly between each others.
